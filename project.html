    <h1>FACTS ABOUT MY DOG</h1>

                This is Max, the four-legged tornado of joy that has taken over my life. With a wagging tail that could
                power a small
                city, he’s not just a pet; he’s a full-time comedian and my personal therapist.

                <p></p>Max is a Golden Retriever, which means he’s got the charm of a movie star and the appetite of a
                hungry hippo. His
                personality? Think of a mix between a goofy clown and a wise old sage—always ready to make you laugh or
                offer a
                comforting paw when life gets tough.
                <p>Every day with Max is an adventure filled with slobbery kisses, epic zoomies, and the occasional
                    ‘oops, I dug up your
                    favorite plant’ moment. He’s not just my dog; he’s my partner in crime, and together, we’re
                    unstoppable!</p>
